# Pathfinding-Visualizer

This Project is a Visualizer for Dijkstra's shortest pathfinding algorithm. It finds out the shortest path between 2 points in a grid in which certain walls/obstructions can be added, so the shortest path doesn't include them. The algorithm visualization takes place as the boxes of the grid being explored change color, and finally, the shortest path is highlighted.
